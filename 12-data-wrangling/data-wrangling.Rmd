## The `subset()` function

- `subset()` is a generic function that returns subsets of vectors, matrices or data frames which meet logical conditions

- It is useful shortcut for subsetting data frames

- `subset()` is meant for interactive data exploration

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
df <-  data.frame(
  name = c("Yu","Matt","Jane","Tim", "Dave", "Marie"),
  inc = c(6, 1, 2, NA, 5, 9),
  gender = factor(c("F", "M","F","M", "M", "F")),
  state = factor(c("AZ","KS", NA, "CA","FL", "MA")))

df
```

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
subset(df, inc > 4)
subset(df, name == "Marie")
subset(df, inc > 4 & name != "Marie")
```

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
subset(df, inc > 4 & name != "Marie" & gender == "F")
subset(df, inc >= 2 & state %in% c("MA", "FL", "CA"))
```

## The `subset()` function

You can use the `select` argument to choose columns:

```{r}
subset(df, inc == 5, select = c(state, name))
subset(df, inc == 5, select = c(1, 4))
subset(df, inc == 5, select = inc:state)
```

## The `subset()` function

And also to drop columns:

```{r}
subset(df, inc == 5, select = -c(state, name))
subset(df, inc == 5, select = -c(state, name, gender))
```

## The `subset()` function

You can use `subset()` to filter out missing data with respect to specific variables:

```{r}
subset(df, !is.na(state), select = c(name, inc))
```

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
subset(df, !is.na(inc) & !is.na(state), 
       select = c(name, inc, state))
```

## The `subset()` function

`subset()`:

  - Also works with vectors, matrices and lists.
  - Doesn’t drop dimensions (by default).

In the logical expressions that indicate which rows to keep, missing values are taken as `FALSE`.

## Modifying columns with `transform()`

`transform()` can be used to modify the columns of a data frame: 

```{r}
transform(df, state = paste0(state, "-US"))
```

## Modifying columns with `transform()`

Let's change how the levels of the `gender` factor are displayed:

```{r}
transform(df, gender = factor(
  gender, labels = c("Female", "Male")))
```

## Modifying columns with `transform()`

Now let's express `inc` in euros:

```{r}
transform(df, inc = ifelse(is.na(inc), NA, 
                           paste0(inc * 1000, "€")
                           )
          )
```

## Create columns with `transform()`

`Transform()` can also be used to create new variables.

Let's create a variable with income in the logarithmic scale:

```{r}
transform(df, logInc = log(inc))
```

## Create columns with `transform()`

Now lets standardize the income column:

```{r}
standardize <- function(x){
  z <- (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))/sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  round(z, 2)
  }
```


```{r}
transform(df, norm_inc = standardize(inc))
```


## Relational models

- Sometimes our tables are related to other tables.

- It is often necessary to complement one table with information from another table, or to cross information between tables.

- We usually join tables by using one or more variables that are present in both tables as a key to match rows from one table to the other.

<!-- 
  - A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row of a table is called a primary they.
  - The primary they of a table is a foreign key in the other tables.
  - Foreign keys can have repeated values.
  - Primary and foreign keys can be used to match rows between tables.
  - We join tables by matching the primary key of a table with the foreign key of another table.
-->

## A simple relational model

```{r}
set.seed(1)

Sales <-data.frame(
  Product = sample(c("Toaster", "Radio", "TV"),
                   size = 7, replace = TRUE),
  CustomerID =c(rep("1_2019", 2), 
                paste(2:3, "2019", sep = "_"), 
                paste(1:3, "2020", sep = "_")))

Sales$Price <- round(ifelse(
  Sales$Product == "TV", rnorm(1, 400, 20),
  ifelse(Sales$Product == "Toaster",
         rnorm(1, 40, 2), rnorm(1, 35, 2))))
```

## A simple relational model

```{r}
set.seed(1)

Clients <-data.frame(
  CustomerID =c(paste(2:4, "2019", sep = "_"),
                paste(1:2, "2020", sep = "_")),
  State = sample(c("CA", "AZ", "IL", "MA"),
                size = 5, replace = TRUE))
```

## A simple relational model

\begincols
  \begincol{.48\textwidth}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(Sales, booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = " Sales")
```

  \endcol
\begincol{.48\textwidth}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(Clients, booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = "Clients")
```

  \endcol
\endcols


<!-- All columns have repeated values: there is no primary key. -->

<!-- Each Clients is uniquely identified by `CustomerID`. `CustomerID` is:

  - a primary key in the `Clients` table 
  - a foreign key in the `Sales` table
-->

## Joining tables

- `CustomerID` is present in both tables and uniquely identifies each row of the `Clients` table. We can therefore use it as a key to match rows from one table to another. 

- In R this can be done with the `merge()` function.

## Inner join

The inner join returns only rows that have matching values in both tables:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID") 
```

## Natural join

A natural join is an inner join where the joining attributes are defined as having equal names, so they need not be stated explicitly:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients) 
```

## Left join

To includes all the rows of x and only those from y that match use `all.x = TRUE`:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID", 
  all.x = TRUE) 
```

## Right join

To include all the rows of y and only those from x that match use `all.y = TRUE`:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID", 
  all.y = TRUE) 
```

## Full outer join

To keep all rows from both tables use `all = TRUE`.

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID", 
  all = TRUE) 
```

## Cross Join 

Cartesian product of the two tables. The output has `nrow(x) * nrow(y)` rows and `ncol(x) + ncol(y)` columns.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

merge(x = Sales, y = Clients, 
      by = NULL)

```

## Joining tables

![Join operations with `Merge()`](figures/joins.jpg){width=400px}

## Joining tables

- If the merging key is a combination of more than one column, you can provide a vector to `by`.

- If the columns used as key have different names in different tables, we need to use `by.x` and `by.y` instead of `by`. 

- If no `by` argument is provided, the tables are merged on the columns with names they both have.

- `all.x`, `all.y,` and `all` are set to FALSE by default. This is why the default join is the natural join.

## The `sqldf` package 

- You can run SQL queries in R using the `sqldf` package.

- SQL queries must be provided to the `sqldf()` function as strings.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(sqldf)
```

## Inner join with `sqldf`

```{r}
sqldf("SELECT CustomerID, Product, Price, State 
       FROM Sales
       JOIN Clients 
       USING(CustomerID)
       ORDER BY CustomerID")
```

## Left join with `sqldf`

```{r}
sqldf("SELECT CustomerID, Product, Price, State 
       FROM Sales
       LEFT JOIN Clients 
       USING(CustomerID)
       ORDER BY CustomerID")
```

## Cross join with `sqldf`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sqldf("SELECT * 
       FROM Sales
       CROSS JOIN Clients 
       ORDER BY CustomerID")
```

## Subgroup summaries with `aggregate()`

- The `aggregate()` function computes subgroup summary statistics

- `aggregate()` collapses datasets across factor levels

## Subgroup summaries with `aggregate()`

```{r}
my_df <- data.frame(
  age = c(22, 36, 21, 39, 33, 45, 34, 59),
  smoker = factor(c("no", "yes", "no", "no", "yes",
                    "no", "yes", "yes")),
  child = factor(c("no", "yes", "no", "no", "yes",
                   "yes", "no", "yes")),
