## Built in datasets 

R has many built in datasets. For a complete list see:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(help = "datasets")
```

In this lecture we will use some of these datasets, namely:

  - airquality
  - USArrests

For information about a specific dataset see, for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?airquality
```

## The `head()` and `tails()` functions

`head()` shows the first rows of a dataframe. `tail()` shows the last rows. Both `head()` and `tails()` print six rows by default. 

```{r}
nrow(airquality)
head(airquality)
```

## The `head()` and `tails()` functions

```{r}
head(airquality, n = 2)
```

```{r}
tail(airquality, n = 3) 
```

## Built in constants

R also provides some built in constants and vectors:

```{r}
head(letters)
tail(letters)

head(LETTERS)
tail(LETTERS)
```

For a complete list of built in constants see `?Constants`

## The `subset()` function

`subset()` is a generic function that can be used to subset data frames using logical conditions. 

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
df <-  data.frame(
  name = c("Yu","Matt","Jane","Tim", "Dave", "Marie"),
  inc = c(6, 1, 2, NA, 5, 9),
  gender = factor(c("F", "M","F","M", "M", "F")),
  state = factor(c("AZ","KS", NA, "CA","FL", "MA")))

df
```

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
subset(df, inc > 4)
subset(df, name == "Marie")
subset(df, inc > 4 & name != "Marie")
```

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
subset(df, inc > 4 & name != "Marie" & gender == "F")
subset(df, inc >= 2 & state %in% c("MA", "FL", "CA"))
```

## The `subset()` function

You can use the `select` argument to choose columns:

```{r}
subset(df, inc == 5, select = c(state, name))
subset(df, inc == 5, select = c(1, 4))
subset(df, inc == 5, select = inc:state)
```

## The `subset()` function

And also to drop columns:

```{r}
subset(df, inc == 5, select = -c(state, name))
subset(df, inc == 5, select = -c(state, name, gender))
```

## The `subset()` function

You can use `subset()` to filter out missing data with respect to specific variables:

```{r}
subset(df, !is.na(state), select = c(name, inc))
```

## The `subset()` function

```{r}
subset(df, !is.na(inc) & !is.na(state), 
       select = c(name, inc, state))
```

## The `subset()` function

`subset()`:

  - Also works with vectors, matrices and lists.
  - Doesn’t drop dimensions (by default).

In the logical expressions that indicate which rows to keep, missing values are taken as `FALSE`.

## Modifying columns with `transform()`

`transform()` can be used to modify the columns of a data frame: 

```{r}
transform(df, state = paste0(state, "-US"))
```

## Modifying columns with `transform()`

Let's change how the levels of the `gender` factor are displayed:

```{r}
transform(df, gender = factor(
  gender, labels = c("Female", "Male")))
```

## Modifying columns with `transform()`

Now let's express `inc` in euros:

```{r}
transform(df, inc = ifelse(is.na(inc), NA, 
                           paste0(inc * 1000, "€")
                           )
          )
```

## Create columns with `transform()`

`Transform()` can also be used to create new variables.

Let's create a variable with income in the logarithmic scale:

```{r}
transform(df, logInc = log(inc))
```

## Create columns with `transform()`

Now lets standardize the income column:

```{r}
standardize <- function(x){
  z <- (x-mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))/sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  round(z, 2)
  }
```


```{r}
transform(df, norm_inc = standardize(inc))
```


## The `USArrests` dataset

Now consider the `USArrests` dataset, with arrests per 100.000 residents in the US for murder, assault and rape. 

```{r}
head(USArrests)
```

## The `USArrests` dataset

```{r}
USArrests_short <- USArrests[1:4, -3]
                            
USArrests_short
```

## Row and column sums

```{r}
colSums(USArrests_short) 
rowSums(USArrests_short) 
```

## Row and column means

```{r}
colMeans(USArrests_short) 
rowMeans(USArrests_short) 
```

## The `apply()` function

To collapse data frames across rows or columns using functions other than the sum and the mean we can use apply():

`apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)`

  - X is a data frame
  - `MARGIN = 1` for rows, `MARGIN = 2` for columns
  - FUN is a function
  - ... are optional arguments to pass to FUN

## The `apply()` function

Apply functions over the columns of `USArrests_short`:

```{r}
apply(USArrests_short, 2, mean)
apply(USArrests_short, 2, median)
apply(USArrests_short, 2, sd)
```

## The `apply()` function

Apply functions the rows of `USArrests_short`:

```{r}
apply(USArrests_short, 1, max)
apply(USArrests_short, 1, min)
apply(USArrests_short, 1, var)

```

## `apply()` vs `for` loop

Loop over the columns of `USArrests_short`:

```{r}
res <- vector()

for(i in 1:ncol(USArrests_short)){
  
  res[i] <- mean(USArrests_short[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
  names(res)[i] <- names(USArrests_short)[i]
}

res
```

## `apply()` vs `for` loop

Loop over the rows of `USArrests_short`:

```{r}
res <- vector()

for(j in 1:nrow(USArrests_short)){
  
  res[j] <- max(USArrests_short[j, ],na.rm = TRUE)
  names(res)[j] <- rownames(USArrests_short)[j]
}

res
```

## `apply()` with `...`

Now let's see an example that requires using dot-dot-dot (`...`).

Try to use `apply()` to compute the means of the first four columns of the `airquality` dataset:

```{r}

head(airquality)
```

## `apply()` with `...`

```{r}
apply(airquality[, 1:4], 2, mean)
```

We get `NA` for the first two columns. Why?

```{r}
sum(is.na(airquality$Ozone))
sum(is.na(airquality$Solar.R))
```

## `apply()` with `...`

Problem: Some columns have `NA`s.

Solution: use `...` to pass the `na.rm` argument to `mean()`:

```{r}
apply(airquality[, 1:4], 2, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## The `lapply()` function

Syntax: `lapply(X, FUN, ...)`

`lapply()` is similar to `apply()` but:

  - X is a vector (atomic or list)
  - There is no MARGINS argument
  - Always returns a list
  
`lapply()` returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.

## The `lapply()` function

```{r}
lapply(c(1:3), log, base = 10)
```

## The `lapply()` function

```{r}
A <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 5)
B <- matrix(c(1, 5, 7, -1), ncol = 4)
C <- matrix(letters[1:4], ncol = 2)

my_list <- list(A, B, C)

```

## The `lapply()` function

```{r}
my_list
```

## The `lapply()` function

Every element of `my_list`, except the last, contain a numerical matrix. Sum the elements of each of those matrices:

```{r}
lapply(my_list[-3], sum)
```

## The `lapply()` function

Extract the element in position (1, 2) from each matrix:

```{r}
lapply(my_list,"[", 1, 2)
```

## The `lapply()` function

Extract the first row from each matrix:

```{r}
lapply(my_list,"[", 1 , )
```

## The `lapply()` function

Extract the 2nd column from each matrix:

```{r}
lapply(my_list,"[", , 2)
```

## `lapply()` vs `for` loop

Extract the 2nd column from each matrix:

```{r}

res <- vector(mode = "list")

for(i in seq_along(my_list)){
  res[[i]] <- my_list[[i]][, 2]
}
res
```

## The `sapply()` function

The sapply() function:

  - Works like lapply(), but simplifies the output to the most elementary data structure that is possible.
  - Returns vectors or matrices.

```{r}
sapply(my_list[-3], sum)
sapply(my_list,"[", 1, 2)
```

## The `sapply()` function

```{r}
set.seed(123)

our_list <- list(
  w = 1:6,
  x = sample(1:5, 4, replace = TRUE),
  y = matrix(sample(1:100, 9), nrow = 3),
  z = sample(1:10, 3, replace = TRUE) 
)

str(our_list)
```

## The `sapply()` function

```{r}
sapply(our_list, max)
sapply(our_list, min)
sapply(our_list, class)
```

## The `sapply()` function

How many numbers are there inside each element of `our_list`?

```{r}
sapply(our_list, length)
```

## The `sapply()` function

```{r}
set.seed(123)

our_list_2 <- list(
  w = 1:6,
  x = sample(1:5, 4, replace = TRUE),
  y = airquality
)
```

```{r}
sapply(our_list_2, class)
dim(airquality)
```

How many numbers are there inside each element of `our_list_2`? 

## The `sapply()` function

The length of a data frame is the number of columns, and hence `sapply(our_list_2, length)` won't do the trick.

```{r}
our_fun <- function(x){
  if(class(x) == "data.frame"){
    nrow(x) * ncol(x)
  }else{
      length(x)
  }
}

sapply(our_list_2, our_fun)
```

## `sapply()` vs `for` loop

The same but with a `for` loop:

```{r}

res <- vector()

for(i in seq_along(our_list_2)){
  
  res[i] <- our_fun(our_list_2[[i]])
  names(res)[i] <- names(our_list_2)[i] 
}

res

```

## The `mapply()` function

`mapply()` is a generalization of `sapply()`.  It applies a multivariate function over multiple vectors of arguments.

## The `mapply()` function

Suppose we want 3 samples of different sizes from a $\operatorname{Normal}(0, 1)$ distribution:

```{r}
set.seed(123)

rnorm(n = 1)
rnorm(n = 2)
rnorm(n = 3)
```

## The `mapply()` function

The same result can be obtained more compactly with `mapply()`:

```{r}
set.seed(123)

sample_size <- 1:3
mapply(FUN = rnorm, n = sample_size)
```

## The `mapply()` function

Since we only iterated over one vector, we could have used `sapply()`:

```{r}
set.seed(123)

sample_size <- 1:3
sapply(FUN = rnorm, X = sample_size)
```

## The `mapply()` function

But what if we want to sample from normal distributions with different means, while still having samples of different sizes? 

```{r}
set.seed(123)

rnorm(n = 1, mean = 5)
rnorm(n = 2, mean = 10)
rnorm(n = 3, mean = -3)
```

## The `mapply()` function

In this case we need to iterate over two vectors, one for sample sizes and one for means:

```{r}
set.seed(123)

sample_size <- 1:3
mu <- c(5, 10, -3)
mapply(rnorm, n = sample_size, mean = mu)

```

## The `mapply()` function

Now suppose we also want each sample to have a different standard deviation:

```{r}
set.seed(123)

rnorm(n = 1, mean = 5, sd = 1)
rnorm(n = 2, mean = 10, sd = 3)
rnorm(n = 3, mean = -3, sd = 5)
```

## The `mapply()` function

```{r}
set.seed(123)

sample_size <- 1:3
mu <- c(5, 10, -3)
sigma <- c(1, 3, 5)

mapply(rnorm, mean = mu, sd = sigma, n = sample_size)
```

## The `mapply()` function

Now suppose we wanted our results with two decimal places only:

```{r}
set.seed(123)

results <- mapply(rnorm, mean = mu, sd = sigma,
                  n = sample_size)
```

```{r}
sapply(results, FUN = round, 2)
```

## `mapply()` vs `for` loop

```{r}
set.seed(123)

sample_size <- 1:3
mu <- c(5, 10,-3)
sigma <- c(1, 3, 5)

res <- vector(mode = "list")

for (i in 1:3) {
  res[[i]] <- round(rnorm(mean = mu[i],
                          sd = sigma[i],
                          n = sample_size[i]),
                    2)
}
```

## `mapply()` vs `for` loop

```{r}
res
```

## Relational models

- Sometimes our tables are related to other tables.

- It is often necessary to complement one table with information from another table, or to cross information between tables.

- We usually join tables by using one or more variables that are present in both tables as a key to match rows from one table to the other.

<!-- 
  - A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row of a table is called a primary they.
  - The primary they of a table is a foreign key in the other tables.
  - Foreign keys can have repeated values.
  - Primary and foreign keys can be used to match rows between tables.
  - We join tables by matching the primary key of a table with the foreign key of another table.
-->

## A simple relational model

```{r}
set.seed(1)

Sales <-data.frame(
  Product = sample(c("Toaster", "Radio", "TV"),
                   size = 7, replace = TRUE),
  CustomerID =c(rep("1_2019", 2), 
                paste(2:3, "2019", sep = "_"), 
                paste(1:3, "2020", sep = "_")))

Sales$Price <- round(ifelse(
  Sales$Product == "TV", rnorm(1, 400, 20),
  ifelse(Sales$Product == "Toaster",
         rnorm(1, 40, 2), rnorm(1, 35, 2))))
```

## A simple relational model

```{r}
set.seed(1)

Clients <-data.frame(
  CustomerID =c(paste(2:4, "2019", sep = "_"),
                paste(1:2, "2020", sep = "_")),
  State = sample(c("CA", "AZ", "IL", "MA"),
                size = 5, replace = TRUE))
```

## A simple relational model

\begincols
  \begincol{.48\textwidth}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(Sales, booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = " Sales")
```

  \endcol
\begincol{.48\textwidth}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(Clients, booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = "Clients")
```

  \endcol
\endcols


<!-- All columns have repeated values: there is no primary key. -->

<!-- Each Clients is uniquely identified by `CustomerID`. `CustomerID` is:

  - a primary key in the `Clients` table 
  - a foreign key in the `Sales` table
-->

## Joining tables

- `CustomerID` is present in both tables and uniquely identifies each row of the `Clients` table. We can therefore use it as a key to match rows from one table to another. 

- In R this can be done with the `merge()` function.

## Inner join

The inner join returns only rows that have matching values in both tables:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID") 
```

## Natural join

A natural join is an inner join where the joining attributes are defined as having equal names, so they need not be stated explicitly:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients) 
```

## Left join

To includes all the rows of x and only those from y that match use `all.x = TRUE`:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID", 
  all.x = TRUE) 
```

## Right join

To include all the rows of y and only those from x that match use `all.y = TRUE`:

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID", 
  all.y = TRUE) 
```

## Full outer join

To keep all rows from both tables use `all = TRUE`.

```{r}
merge(x = Sales, y = Clients,
  by = "CustomerID", 
  all = TRUE) 
```

## Cross Join 

Cartesian product of the two tables. The output has `nrow(x) * nrow(y)` rows and `ncol(x) + ncol(y)` columns.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

merge(x = Sales, y = Clients, 
      by = NULL)

```

## Joining tables

![Join operations with `Merge()`](figures/joins.jpg){width=400px}

## Joining tables

- If the merging key is a combination of more than one column, you can provide a vector to `by`.

- If the columns used as key have different names in different tables, we need to use `by.x` and `by.y` instead of `by`. 

- If no `by` argument is provided, the tables are merged on the columns with names they both have.

- `all.x`, `all.y,` and `all` are set to FALSE by default. This is why the default join is the natural join.

## The `sqldf` package 

- You can run SQL queries in R using the `sqldf` package.

- SQL queries must be provided to the `sqldf()` function as strings.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(sqldf)
```

## Inner join with `sqldf`

```{r}
sqldf("SELECT CustomerID, Product, Price, State 
       FROM Sales
       JOIN Clients 
       USING(CustomerID)
       ORDER BY CustomerID")
```

## Left join with `sqldf`

```{r}
sqldf("SELECT CustomerID, Product, Price, State 
       FROM Sales
       LEFT JOIN Clients 
       USING(CustomerID)
       ORDER BY CustomerID")
```

## Cross join with `sqldf`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sqldf("SELECT * 
       FROM Sales
       CROSS JOIN Clients 
       ORDER BY CustomerID")
```

## Subgroup summaries with `aggregate()`

The `aggregate()` function can be used to compute subgroup summary statistics.

## Subgroup summaries with `aggregate()`

```{r}
my_df <- data.frame(
  age = c(22, 36, 21, 39, 33, 45, 34, 59),
  smoker = factor(c("no", "yes", "no", "no", "yes",
                    "no", "yes", "yes")),
  child = factor(c("no", "yes", "no", "no", "yes",
                   "yes", "no", "yes")),

  GROUP BY child"
)
```

## Subgroup summaries with `sqldf()`

Compare the age of the younger person with children with the age of the younger person without children:

```{r}
sqldf(
  "SELECT child, min(age) as age 
  FROM my_df
  GROUP BY child"
)
```

## Subgroup summaries with `sqldf()`

What is the age of the older smoker?

```{r}
sqldf(
  "SELECT max(age) as age 
  FROM my_df
  GROUP BY smoker
  HAVING smoker = 'yes'
  "
)
```

## Subgroup summaries with `aggregate()`

We can divide our subgroups further into more subgroups:

```{r}
sqldf(
  "SELECT smoker, AVG(income) as income
  FROM my_df
  GROUP BY child, smoker
  "
)
```

## Subgroup summaries with `sqldf()`

On average, do parents who smoke earn more than parents who don't smoke?

```{r}
sqldf(
  "SELECT smoker, AVG(income) as income
  FROM my_df
  GROUP BY child, smoker
  HAVING child = 'yes'
  "
)
```
